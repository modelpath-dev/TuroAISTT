The SMARCB1 (INI1) gene causes conformational changes in the nucleosome, thereby altering histone-DNA binding and facilitating transcription factor access. Mutations in SMARCB1 correspond to the loss of expression by immunohistochemistry using the INI-1/BAF47 antibody.17 This antibody shows strong nuclear expression in normal tissues; however, nuclear expression is lost (aberrant expression) in rhabdoid tumor nuclei. Additionally, a variety of other tumors may also show loss of INI-1 by immunohistochemistry to include renal medullary carcinoma, epithelioid sarcoma, among several others. Molecular testing for SMARCB1 mutations is not necessary for the diagnosis of RTK, but may be utilized in the workup, particularly to identify germline mutations.",
