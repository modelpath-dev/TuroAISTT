Hence, all attempts for fine-needle aspiration should be discouraged in favor of biopsy or resection.\n\nThe current recommendation for hepatoblastoma diagnosis is a tumor biopsy, except for rare cases for which upfront resection may be performed. This is the recommendation made by the international consensus classification1 and will be followed in future Children’s Oncology Group (COG) studies in alignment with other international protocols. Hepatoblastomas are usually solitary lesions that occupy one of the lobes of the liver but may transgress more than 1 liver segment (the basis for pretreatment extent of disease [PRETEXT] staging). Multifocal lesions also occur, and multifocal tumors are the most likely cases to be diagnosed by biopsy. Any tumor that is not radiologically PRETEXT I or II may be biopsied upfront, as primary resection may not be an option. Even with lower stage disease, large vessel invasion will be a contraindication to primary resection and will warrant preoperative chemotherapy.",

Biopsy types include image guided needle biopsy (the more common scenario in the US) or open biopsy for cases that are difficult to access, or in which there is potential for surgical resection. While it is much easier to get adequate tissue for studies with open biopsies, a needle biopsy done in interventional radiology is adequate for diagnosis as long as multiple (5-10) needle cores are obtained.2 It is also recommended that the radiologist obtain needle cores from different portions of the tumor to maximize sampling of all areas of interest in the tumor. Calcified, bony, or hard tissue need not be sampled, however, and focus should be placed on obtaining adequate representation of the viable epithelial component. The region from which the biopsy is obtained should be noted if possible. If tumor involves more than 1 lobe, more than 1 lesion or area of the tumor should be sampled. These sites should be labeled separately, as different nodules in the same patient may have different histologies and biology. As most needle biopsy procedures are ultrasound guided, it may be easy to differentiate between tumor and uninvolved liver, and an attempt should be made to acquire adjacent nontumor liver tissue to understand underlying disease processes.",

The goal of the biopsy is tissue diagnosis to separate hepatoblastomas (the most common pediatric tumors) from other benign (especially mesenchymal hamartoma, adenomas, and focal nodular hyperplasia) or malignant (pediatric hepatocellular carcinoma and embryonal sarcoma) liver tumors, which are treated differently. Regardless of the procedure type, every attempt should be made to assess if tissue obtained is viable and can be triaged for other studies. Imprint cytology may be used to assess tumor viability. No tissue diagnosis is needed at the time of frozen section, for that is the purpose of doing the biopsy, and the surgeon should be so educated. Tissue should instead be set aside for snap freezing (tumor and normal) as well as for cytogenetics (tumor only), following institutional practices and when feasible. While tissue may be set aside for electron microscopy, it is left to individual Institutions to make that decision.

In the Pediatric Oncology Group series from 1986-20022,3, 66% of hepatoblastomas were manifest by the second year, and 11% before 6 months of age. Approximately 50% of those in infants were congenital, given their size when discovered by 2-3 months of age; 6% of hepatoblastomas occurred after 5 years of age. Hepatocellular carcinomas have been observed as early as 6 months of age. Seven examples of mixed hepatoblastomas and hepatocellular carcinomas have been observed at a mean age of 8.5 years; perinatally acquired hepatitis B virus was responsible in 3 instances. Yolk sac tumors are more common in early childhood, but they also occur rarely in older adults; of note, a component of yolk sac tumor may be present in teratoid hepatoblastoma. Systemic malignancies and metastatic disease must be considered at all ages because hepatomegaly due to megakaryoblastic leukemia, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, and neuroblastoma are important sources of confusion with hepatoblastoma in infancy, as are intraabdominal desmoplastic small round cell tumors later in childhood.",

The presence of TERT promoter mutations is characteristic of the hepatocellular neoplasm, not otherwise specified (HCN-NOS) provisional subtype. Several recent hepatoblastoma genomic profiling studies have reported variants and copy number alterations in additional genes7,9,10  involving pathways potentially implicated in hepatoblastoma development and clinical behavior, including Notch, Sonic Hedgehog, PI3K/AKT, EGFR and Hippo pathway (YAP), among others.7,8,13,14",

Transcriptomic profiling initially demonstrated two distinct genotype-phenotype hepatoblastoma subtypes, one with a more mature phenotype corresponding to fetal histology, and a second one recapitulating early fetal life liver, and with embryonal histology.15 Later genomic studies demonstrated additional molecular risk-associated subtypes, with high-risk tumors being characterized by high NFE2L2 activity, high LIN28B, HMGA2, SALL4, and AFP expression, as well as low let-7 expression and HNF1A activity.7 Recently, HB epigenomic profiling demonstrated genome-wide dysregulation of RNA editing in HB and identified additional epigenomic clusters, including an aggressive subgroup identified by characteristic methylation features, strong 14q32 locus expression, as well as CTNNB1 and NFE2L2 mutations and a progenitor-like phenotype.16 Unfortunately, none of these transcriptomic or epigenomic prognostic-associated clusters have yet been clinically validated in large prospective studies and are currently not being used for risk stratification. Systematic banking of hepatoblastoma tumor material remains of great importance to further investigate the clinical relevance of these molecular abnormalities and biological groups, so they could be incorporated in more precise risk stratification algorithms.",

This concern has since been refuted in a publication from a recently concluded Children’s Oncology Group trial demonstrating that the presence of SCU pattern is not associated with a poor prognosis.1 There is consensus opinion from HB experts that low AFP (<100 ng/mL) values can be seen in association with small tumors, incidentally diagnosed on imaging obtained for an unrelated reason or during surveillance for a known cancer predisposition syndrome. Tumors associated with a normal AFP, previously perceived to be HB, are now, in hindsight, known to be malignant rhabdoid tumors or tumors of a different histology altogether.",

There are two important factors to keep in mind when interpreting the clinical utility of AFP. First, there are tumors other than HB that secrete AFP, including pediatric hepatocellular carcinomas, germ cell tumors, and rare pancreatic tumors. Second, AFP is markedly elevated in the perinatal period and in the subsequent months of life which can impact the diagnostic relevance of this lab value. The Children’s Hepatic tumors International Collaboration (CHIC) risk-stratification tool derived from the retrospective analysis of 1200 patients with HB treated on clinical trials conducted within four consortia demonstrates that gradations of AFP at diagnosis <100, 100-1000, or >1000 might be relevant for prognosis.2 While work in the germ cell tumor literature links the kinetics of AFP decline during therapy with long-term outcome, there is limited data in hepatoblastoma linking log-fold decline of AFP to outcome and more work is being done to clarify this relationship.3,4,5",
