Some assays use a single HER2 (ERBB2) probe to determine the number of HER2 (ERBB2) gene copies present, but most assays include a chromosome enumeration probe (CEP17) to determine the ratio of HER2 (ERBB2) signals to copies of chromosome 17. ISH has been used to verify IHC-equivocal cases.5 HER2-positive gastric cancer has been defined as IHC 3+ or ISH positive in the USA and Japan, and IHC 3+ or 2+ with ISH positivity in Europe.4,8  In the US, the FDA has approved trastuzumab in association with chemotherapy for metastatic gastric cancer utilizing the eligibility criteria of the ToGA trial, limited to patients with a score of IHC 3+ or 2+ and ISH positivity.

Detection of HER2 (ERBB2) gene amplification by FISH is similar to that in breast cancer according to the American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists (ASCO/CAP) 2013 guidelines, in which HER2 (ERBB2) amplification is defined as HER2 (ERBB2):CEP17 ratio of ≥2.11 Hoffman et al developed a four-tier scoring system for IHC (Table 1), also used in the ToGA trial, for gastric cancer by using the assessment area cutoff of at least 10% stained tumor cells for resection specimens and a small cluster of cells (≥5 neoplastic cells) for biopsy specimens.7  The NCCN guidelines recommend that assessment for HER2 status should be performed first using immunohistochemistry following the modified scoring system used in the ToGA trial. A score of 0 or 1+ is considered to be negative for HER2 expression. A score of 2+ is considered equivocal and should be confirmed with FISH or other in situ hybridization techniques. The NCCN panel recommends FISH only for cases with IHC 2+, although some institutions routinely perform both IHC and FISH on all cases. The guidelines recommend trastuzumab with chemotherapy only for patients with IHC 3+ and IHC 2+ with evidence of HER2 (ERBB2) amplification by ISH (HER2 (ERBB2):CEP17 ratio ≥2).
