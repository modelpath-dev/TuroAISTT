Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) refers to the clonal expansion of a mutated hematopoietic progenitor cells. Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is defined as CH that harbors myeloid malignancy associated genes detected in blood or bone marrow at variant allele frequency (VAF) ≥2% (≥4% for X-linked gene mutations in males) in individuals without cytopenia or other diagnosed hematologic disorder. Clonal hematopoiesis of undetermined significance (CCUS) is diagnosed when CHIP criteria are accompanied by clinical cytopenia (Hgb <13g/dL males, <12g/dL females, absolute neutrophil count <1.8x109/L, platelet count <150x109/L) without evidence of diagnostic myeloid neoplasm. Reporting of CHIP or CCUS using the cancer case summary is optional.\n\nMyeloid Neoplasms, Chronic\n\nMyeloproliferative neoplasms\n\nMyeloproliferative neoplasms represent a group of myeloid neoplasms characterized by the abnormal proliferation of one or more terminally differentiated myeloid cell lines, sometimes with increased bone marrow reticulin or collagen fibrosis. The WHO 5th edition retains the framework of the revised WHO 4th edition for diagnostic entities with minor changes. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) accelerated phase (AP) has been removed as its relevance in the era of highly effective targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors makes determination of ABL1 kinase resistance mutations, cytogenetic progression, and overt blast phase drive treatment decisions.2",

The subtype of systemic mastocytosis, bone marrow mastocytosis, has been added along with updates to the B- (burden of disease) criteria for subtyping systemic mastocytosis.\n\nThe cancer case summary lists the subtypes of systemic mastocytosis as the diagnostic choices. The approach to subtyping requires first the establishment of the diagnosis of systemic mastocytosis (see Table 2 for diagnostic criteria), followed by the application of the criteria (see Table 3 for B- and C-findings required for subtypes) for each of the subtypes shown in Table 4. A rare morphologic pattern that is worth noting, but not a defined subtype, is well-differentiated systemic mastocytosis (WDSM) which is characterized by round and well-granulated mast cells that are usually negative for KIT codon 816 mutation (15% positive, may possess KIT mutations outside TK2 domain) and negative for CD2 and CD25, but positive for CD30.3",

The new classification groups MDS into two broad categories; those that are defined by genetic abnormalities and those that are morphologically defined. This approach is analogous to the groupings of acute myeloid leukemia and will enhance diagnostic consistency and highlight the importance of certain genetic alterations to MDS. The threshold for presence of dysplasia is set at 10% of cells of that lineage (erythroid, myeloid, megakaryocytic). Furthermore, diagnostic categories are appended with low blasts or increased blasts for additional clarity.\n\nThe major diagnostic criteria for MDS with defining genetic abnormalities are shown in Table 5. Myelodysplastic neoplasm with low blasts and 5q deletion (MDS-5q) may possess SF3B1 mutations and non-biallelic TP53 alterations (niTP53) if present. Myelodysplastic neoplasm with low blasts and SF3B1 mutation (MDS-SF3B1) was introduced to capture the high association between the presence of SF3B1 mutation and ring sideroblasts (>90% of cases of MDS with ≥5% ring sideroblasts). If ring sideroblasts are identified and SF3B1 mutation is absent, after exclusion of secondary causes of ring sideroblasts, it is acceptable to diagnose these cases as MDS with low blasts and ring sideroblasts in the narrative report. These can be reported as MDS with low blasts as the diagnostic category and denote the presence of ring sideroblasts. Biallelic TP53 (biTP53) alterations are a poor prognosis category of MDS characterized by alterations in TP53 that result in no functional/wild-type TP53.6 The presence of one or more TP53 mutations with copy number loss or evidence of copy neutral loss of heterozygosity (LOH) are considered sufficient for demonstration of biTP53/loss of wild type TP53. TP53 with >49% variant allele frequency (VAF) may be regarded as presumptive evidence of allelic loss or copy neutral LOH if a constitutional TP53 variant can be excluded.7",

It is important to exclude secondary causes of hypocellularity with dysplastic changes such as drug or toxin exposure and exclude aplastic anemia (AA) or paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). In addition, exclusion of a genetic predisposition to bone marrow failure, particularly in younger patients, should be considered.\n\nThe distinction of single- and multilineage dysplasia in the classification of MDS has been removed to reflect the absence of a well-defined category and fluidity of lineage dysplasia over the disease course of MDS.

Clinical presentation is similar to myeloproliferative neoplasms with elevated white blood cells counts, bone marrow hypercellularity, and extramedullary involvement being common.13 Unlike many of the AML with defining genetic alterations above, these neoplasms are classified as blast phase/acute myeloid leukemia only when blasts are ≥20% in blood or bone marrow. A summary table of salient diagnostic features is shown in Table 12. Several diagnostic points are worth emphasizing. First, eosinophilia is common in these disorders but not invariably present, so a high index of suspicion is warranted when some, but not all features are present. This is important as the FIP1L1::PDGFRA is not detected on routine karyotype and requires FISH or molecular studies to demonstrate the rearrangement. Second, many of the neoplasms in myeloid/lymphoid with eosinophilia and defining gene rearrangements may present with atypical mast cell infiltrates both morphologically (spindled, clustered) and by immunophenotype (CD25+), and therefore these should be excluded when considering the diagnosis of mast cell neoplasms.14,15",

          "label": "Acute Leukemias of Mixed or Ambiguous Lineage\n\nAcute leukemias of ambiguous lineage are neoplasms composed of ≥20% blasts in the blood or bone marrow that do not show differentiation along a single lineage (mixed phenotype acute leukemia/MPAL) or fail to demonstrate lineage differentiation (acute undifferentiated leukemia/AUL). MPAL may consist of a single, well-defined blast population that expresses lineage-defining antigens (see Table 13) of two or more lineages (termed biphenotypic), multiple distinct blast populations that each express lineage-defining antigens (bilineal/ bilineage) or a combination of these two. To clarify, in cases of bilineal/bilineage acute leukemia, the aggregate count of the two distinct abnormal blasts populations is used to define the total blast count and meet criteria for ≥20% blasts. \n\nThe assessment of antigen expression to determine lineage assignment is best performed by flow cytometry due to its ability to identify discrete populations based on multiparametric analysis and ability to quantify antigen expression. The criteria for the assignment of B-, T-, and myeloid lineage is shown in Table 13. Briefly, B-lineage is defined using CD19 expression coupled with additional antigens based on the intensity of CD19. T-lineage is defined by cytoplasmic or surface CD3 expression. Myeloid lineage by myeloperoxidase expression or expression of more than one marker of monocytic differentiation. Leukemias that have a well-defined single lineage assignment that express antigens associated with another lineage but not lineage-defining should be considered acute leukemia with aberrant antigen expression and not defined as MPAL.\n\nLeukemias that can more accurately be assigned to another well-defined entity but meeting the criteria for MPAL or AUL should be assigned to that category; common examples include acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with RUNX1::RUNX1T1 fusion, acute myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and blast phase chronic myeloid leukemia. A summary of the diagnostic features of leukemias with ambiguous lineage with defining genetic abnormalities and acute leukemias with ambiguous lineage, immunophenotypically defined as shown in Tables 14 and 15, respectively.\n\nTABLE 13.

          "label": "Flow Cytometry\n\nFlow cytometry is a quantitative method for rapid, multiparametric evaluation of the expression of cell surface and cytoplasmic antigens of a large number of cells. If flow cytometry is performed, report if there was no aberrancy detected in the sample at the level of sensitivity of the assay or specify what specific alterations were detected. As there is substantial variability in the reporting of results the cancer case summary does not require a specific method. It is recommended to report the result on the tumor cell population in a semi-quantitative method that would allow those reviewing the report to determine if there is heterogenous expression (not all tumor cells are positive) and the level of expression on the population. Examples of this reporting include: CD34 dim+ (low-level expression of CD34), CD34+ (moderate level of expression of CD34), CD34++ (bright expression of CD34), CD34-/+ het (variable heterogeneous expression of CD34).\n\nCytogenetics\n\nReport if conventional/karyotype cytogenetic analysis was performed on the sample, and if performed, the result. For those samples with abnormal karyotypes, specify the result.\n\nFluorescence In-situ Hybridization\n\nReport the results of any fluorescence in-situ hybridization performed by listing probes that were tested with normal results and those that showed an abnormal signal pattern. \n\nMolecular Alterations Detected\n\nWith the advent of increasingly sophisticated molecular genetic techniques such as next-generation sequencing (NGS), chromosomal microarrays, and large fluorescence in-situ hybridization panels reporting all of these results in a synoptic format is a challenge. As many of these alterations are diagnostically, prognostically, or therapeutically significant- reporting in a succinct manner is necessary. To make reporting easier for the pathologist and highlight what is most important for the treating clinician, this cancer case summary requires the reporting of any positive/abnormal alterations that were detected followed by an optional listing of all the alterations that were tested. The cancer case summary lists some of the most common genetic alterations that occur in myeloid neoplasms, but it is in no way comprehensive. The option exists to provide the molecular alterations not specifically listed under “Other alterations listed (specify),” where the user would enter what molecular alteration was detected.\n\nAfter each alteration, there is a specific field where users can delineate, if desired, specific alterations, methodology (NGS, for example), or additional information (variant allele frequency VAF) that would be useful for that institution. While preferable to include specific information, this could also reference a separate report with this information (separate molecular pathology report). An example of how to use this section is as follows:\n\nMolecular Alterations Detected (select all those with significant mutations)\n\n_X_ DNMT3A mutation, (specify): DNMT3A R882H, VAF 47%, NGS\n_X_ FLT3 interim tandem duplication (ITD), (specify): (PCR)/Capillary Electrophoresis, signal ratio 9.5\n_X_ NPM1 mutation, (specify): c.578A>G→p.K193R, VAF 40%, NGS\n\nMolecular alterations assayed:\n(List): ABL1, ANKRD26, APC, ARAF, ASXL1, ATM, ATRX, BCOR, BCORL1, BLM, BRAF, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CALR, CBL, CBLB, CBLC, CDKN2A, CEBPA, CHEK2, CSF3R, CTC1, CUX1, CXCR4, DDX41, DKC1, DNMT3A, ELANE, EPCAM, ERCC4, ETNK1, ETV6, EZH2, FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, FANCI, FANCL, FANCM, FBXW7, FLT3, G6PC3, GATA1, GATA2, GFI1, GNAS, GNB1, HAX1, HRAS, IDH1, IDH2, IKZF1, IKZF3, ITPKB, JAK2, JAK3, KDM6A, KIT, KMT2A, KRAS, MAP2K1, MET, MLH1, MPL, MSH2, MSH6, MYD88, NF1, NHP2, NOP10, NOTCH1, NPM1, NRAS, PALB2, PDGFRA, PHF6, PIGA, PML, PMS2, PPM1D, PTEN, PTPN11, RAD21, RAD51C, RB1, RPL11, RPL35A, RPL5, RPS10, RPS17, RPS26, RPS7, RTEL1, RUNX1, SAMD9, SAMD9L, SBDS, SETBP1, SETD2, SF3B1, SH2B3, SLX4, SMC1A, SMC3, SRP72, SRSF2, STAG2, STAT3, STAT5B, SUZ12, TERC, TERT, TET2, TINF2, TP53, U2AF1, VHL, WAS, WRAP53, WT1, ZRSR2\n\nThis method can simplify the reporting of large numbers of genes to highlight only those with alterations identified.
