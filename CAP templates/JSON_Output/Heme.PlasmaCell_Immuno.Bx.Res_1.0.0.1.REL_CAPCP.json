In addition, paraneoplastic syndromes recognized to occur in association with plasma cell myeloma have been incorporated in WHO 5th edition including TEMPI syndrome (telangiectasia, elevated erythropoietin and erythrocytosis, monoclonal gammopathy, perinephric fluid collection and intrapulmonary shunting) and AESOP syndrome (adenopathy and extensive skin patch overlying plasmacytoma). While these are important clinically, since they either represent clinical manifestations of premalignant or overt plasma cell myeloma, they are not included as specific diagnostic entities in the cancer case summary.\n\nUpdates to the diagnostic criteria for plasma cell myeloma and staging using the Revised International Staging System for Multiple Myeloma proposed by the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) has been incorporated in the WHO 5th edition.\n\nThe full diagnostic criteria for the diagnostic categories in the WHO 5th edition are well summarized in the WHO monograph and beyond the scope of the explanatory notes. Essential diagnostic information is included in the explanatory notes to serve as a quick reference. Specific categories that may benefit from additional explanation, particularly regarding use of the cancer case summary, are discussed.\n\nPlasma Cell Neoplasms\n\nSolitary plasmacytoma of bone (SPB)/extramedullary plasmacytoma (EMP)\n\nPlasmacytoma is a solitary, clonal neoplasm of plasma cells without clinical or pathologic evidence of plasma cell myeloma/multiple myeloma or evidence of end-organ damage attributable to plasma cell neoplasia. There are two subtypes of plasmacytoma that are listed in the diagnostic choices in the cancer case summary: solitary plasmacytoma or bone (SPB) and extramedullary plasmacytoma (EMP). Biopsies for solitary plasmacytoma of bone are typically targeted at a lytic lesion involving the axial/hematopoietic skeleton, frequently spine, pelvis, ribs, or skull. \n\nExtramedullary plasmacytoma (EMP) frequently involves the upper respiratory tract with much less frequent involvement of lymph nodes, lung, or other sites. An important consideration for extramedullary plasmacytoma (EMP) is to exclude the presence of a B-cell lymphoma that displays marked plasma cell differentiation, typically nodal or extranodal marginal zone lymphomas. These can be distinguished by mature B-cell immunophenotype (CD19+, CD20 more than moderate intensity), IgM expression, and absence of typical immunophenotype for plasma cell neoplasms.2 In addition, flow cytometry can demonstrate monotypic light chain expression on B-cells. In cases displaying plasmablastic morphology characterized by enlarged, atypical plasmacytoid cells with high proliferative fraction as determined by Ki-67 immunohistochemistry, it is important to exclude plasmablastic lymphoma. These typically occur in immunosuppressed or elderly with frequent demonstration of Epstein Barr virus (EBV), (EBV early RNA by in-situ hybridization, EBER), and MYC rearrangements.\n\nFollowing biopsy, these patients should undergo a thorough evaluation to exclude PCM/MM. For use of the cancer case summary, it is still acceptable to diagnose SBP or EMP with a notation in the narrative report or comment that this diagnosis requires exclusion of PCM/MM.\n\nPlasma Cell Neoplasm Involving Bone Marrow\n\nPlasma cell myeloma/multiple myeloma (PCM/MM) is a bone marrow-based, multifocal neoplastic proliferation of plasma cells very frequently associated with production of a monoclonal immunoglobulin in serum and/or urine with associated evidence of end-organ damage. The diagnosis of PCM/MM relies on the integration of pathologic findings and clinical findings. The diagnostic criteria for PCM/MM are summarized in Table 1. Briefly, PCM/MM is defined by ≥ 10% clonal plasma cells on a non-targeted bone marrow sampling or biopsy proven plasmacytoma on targeted biopsy and one or more myeloma defining events, either end-organ damage (CRAB criteria outlined below) or myeloma defining biomarkers.\n\nSince the diagnosis is based on the integration of clinical findings, such as radiographic studies or laboratory values that may not be available to the pathologist; the cancer case summary includes a diagnostic category of “Plasma cell neoplasm involving bone marrow (clinical information required)”. The percentage of clonal plasma cells is to be specified in the morphologic findings.\n\nIf clinical criteria are available or provided, PCM/MM may be selected in the cancer case summary. The subtype of smoldering (asymptomatic) myeloma is an optional selection if it is known there is no evidence of end-organ damage, amyloidosis or myeloma defining biomarkers, and sufficient serum or urine monoclonal protein (IgG or IgA ≥ 3% gm/dL in serum, ≥ 500 mg per 24h in urine). \n\nThe WHO 5th edition lowered the threshold to diagnose plasma cell leukemia (PCL) to require only ≥ 5% circulating plasma cells in blood in patients otherwise diagnosed with PCL/MM. If blood smears meeting criteria are available for review as part of a bone marrow specimen. It is recommended to perform a minimum 100-200 nucleated cell count on blood for newly diagnosed PCM/MM patients.3",

There is no proscriptive way to accomplish this and can reflect what is used at the institutional level. Suggested reporting methods could utilize (+) for positive result and (-) for negative and include descriptors if there is variability in staining (focal, patchy) or intensity (dim, bright staining). Immunohistochemistry is delineated separately from immunophenotyping by flow cytometry as there might be differences due to the different sensitivities of the assays (flow cytometry is typically more sensitive), differences in antibody used, differences in localization of the antigens (immunohistochemistry may be positive for cytoplasmic antigens that are negative on surface analysis by flow cytometry). To avoid potential confusion, these results are separated out even though some may be redundant.\n\nFlow Cytometry\n\nFlow cytometry is a quantitative method for rapid, multiparametric evaluation of the expression of cell surface and cytoplasmic antigens. If flow cytometry was performed, report if there was no aberrancy detected in the sample at the level of sensitivity of the assay or specify what specific alterations were detected. Of note, flow cytometry may significantly underestimate the number of plasma cells in the sample, but quantitation of level of antigen expression is not impacted by the nature of the cells/specimen.\n\nAs there is significant variability in the reporting of results, the cancer case summary does not require a specific method. It is recommended to report the result on the tumor cell population in a semi-quantitative method that would allow those reviewing the report to determine if there is heterogenous expression (not all tumor cells are positive) and the level of expression on the population. Examples of this reporting include: CD20 dim+ (low-level expression of CD20), CD56+ (moderate level of expression of CD56), CD38++ (bright expression of CD38), CD45 -/+ het (variable heterogeneous expression of CD45).\n\nCytogenetics\n\nReport if conventional/ karyotype cytogenetic analysis was performed on the sample, and if it was performed, the result.  For those samples with abnormal karyotypes, specify the result.\n\nFluorescence In Situ Hybridization\n\nSelect all the results of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) that were performed. For probes with normal results specify those in the normal choice; abnormal results can be reported under the respective choice.  Common alterations detected by FISH are listed. \n\nMolecular Alterations Detected\n\nWith the advent of increasingly sophisticated molecular genetic techniques such as next-generation sequencing (NGS), chromosomal microarrays and large fluorescence in-situ hybridization panels reporting all these results in a synoptic format is a challenge. As this is an emerging area in evaluation of plasma cell and paraprotein associated disorders, the reporting is optional. The cancer case summary may be used to report what was performed and positive results along with any pertinent additional information such as method (NGS, RT-PCR, etc.).",
